A Swift package that provides Mailgun email integration for [swift-identities](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-identities) authentication system.

## Overview

This package bridges the gap between swift-identities authentication system and Mailgun email service, providing ready-to-use email templates for all identity-related communications:

- ‚úÖ Email verification
- üîê Password reset and change notifications
- üìß Email address change confirmations
- üóëÔ∏è Account deletion notifications
- üåç Multi-language support (Dutch/English)

## Installation

Add this package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-identities-mailgun", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup with Live Mailgun

```swift
import IdentitiesMailgunLive
import Dependencies

// Configure your business details
let business = BusinessDetails(
    name: "MyApp",
    supportEmail: "support@myapp.com",
    fromEmail: "noreply@myapp.com"
)

// Create the identity client with Mailgun integration
let identityClient = Identity.Client.mailgun(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter
)

// The client will automatically use the Mailgun dependency
// configured in your application
```

### Development/Testing with Logging

For local development without sending actual emails:

```swift
let identityClient = Identity.Client.mailgunLogging(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter
)
// This will log all email operations without sending emails
```

### Custom Email Sending

If you need more control over the email sending process:

```swift
let identityClient = Identity.Client.mailgun(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter,
    sendEmail: { request in
        // Custom email sending logic
        try await myCustomMailgunClient.send(request)
    }
)
```

## Email Templates

All email templates are built using type-safe HTML DSL from `coenttb-html` and include:

- Professional, responsive design
- Multi-language support (Dutch/English)
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Security notices where appropriate
- Support contact information

### Available Templates
